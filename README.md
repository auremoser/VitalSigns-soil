## Vital Signs - Soils
soil chemicals (acidified carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen) by plot + sample ID

### Description
* This map provices a breakdown of soil chemicals (acidified carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen) by plot + sample ID
* The data is available in as a csv (located in the `data/soil_data` folder).


### Next steps
Visualizations for these data might fall into two categories, the second of which is visualized here.
* Cat-1: Maps to illustrate where the plots fall and show correlation to other mapped data
* Cat-2: Graph to illustrate the values collected by sensors at the subplots

### Demo
You can find the work in progress demo [here](http://auremoser.github.io/VitalSigns-soil/).

It should look something like this:
